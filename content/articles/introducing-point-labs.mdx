We're building at the intersection of AI and Web3, exploring new frontiers in decentralized intelligence.

## Our Mission

At Point Labs, we believe the future of artificial intelligence lies in decentralization. Traditional AI development is concentrated in the hands of a few large corporations, creating concerns about access, transparency, and control.

We're changing that narrative by building open infrastructure that enables:

- **Distributed model training** across global compute networks
- **Verifiable AI inference** using zero-knowledge proofs
- **Fair incentive mechanisms** for contributors and validators

## Why Now?

The convergence of several technological advances makes this the perfect time to build decentralized AI:

1. Matured blockchain infrastructure capable of handling complex coordination
2. Advances in cryptographic techniques like zkSNARKs and zkSTARKs
3. Growing demand for transparent and auditable AI systems
4. Community-driven development models proving their effectiveness

## What We're Building

Our initial focus is on three core areas:

### Decentralized Training Networks

We're developing protocols that allow distributed compute providers to collaborate on training large models without centralized coordination.

### Privacy-Preserving Inference

Using zero-knowledge proofs, we're building systems where users can verify AI outputs without revealing their inputs.

### Token Economics for AI

We're designing incentive mechanisms that fairly reward all participants in the AI value chain—from data providers to compute contributors.

## Join Us

We're just getting started, and there's much work to be done. If you're excited about the future of decentralized AI, we'd love to hear from you.

Follow our journey as we build the infrastructure for the next generation of AI systems.
