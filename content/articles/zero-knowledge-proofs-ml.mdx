Exploring zkML and its implications for privacy-preserving AI inference.

## What is zkML?

Zero-knowledge machine learning (zkML) combines cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs with AI inference. The result: systems that can prove an AI computation was performed correctly without revealing the inputs, model weights, or intermediate values.

## Why Does This Matter?

Consider these scenarios:

### Medical Diagnosis

A patient wants to use an AI diagnostic tool but doesn't want to share their medical data with the service provider. With zkML, the patient can receive a diagnosis while keeping their data private.

### Financial Modeling

A hedge fund wants to prove their AI-driven trades comply with regulations without revealing their proprietary model or trading strategy.

### Model Verification

A user wants to verify that a claimed AI model was actually used for their inference, not a cheaper substitute.

## How It Works

At a high level, zkML works by:

1. **Converting the model** into an arithmetic circuit representation
2. **Generating a proof** that the circuit was evaluated correctly on given inputs
3. **Verifying the proof** without needing access to the original computation

The mathematical guarantees of zero-knowledge proofs ensure that:

- The computation was performed correctly (soundness)
- No information about inputs/weights leaks (zero-knowledge)
- The proof is compact and fast to verify (succinctness)

## Current Limitations

zkML is still an emerging field with significant challenges:

### Computational Overhead

Generating ZK proofs for large models is extremely expensive—often 1000x or more compared to regular inference.

### Model Size Constraints

Current proving systems struggle with models larger than a few million parameters. Production LLMs have billions.

### Quantization Effects

Converting floating-point operations to field arithmetic introduces precision loss that can affect model accuracy.

## The Path Forward

Despite these limitations, rapid progress is being made:

- New proof systems optimized for ML operations
- Hardware acceleration for proof generation
- Techniques for proving partial computations
- Hybrid approaches combining trusted execution with ZK proofs

## Our Research

At Point Labs, we're exploring practical applications of zkML:

- Verifiable inference for sensitive applications
- Proof aggregation to amortize costs across many inferences
- Novel circuit designs optimized for transformer architectures

## Conclusion

zkML represents a fundamental shift in how we can build trustworthy AI systems. While production-ready systems for large models are still years away, the foundation is being established today.

We'll be sharing more technical details about our zkML research in upcoming posts.
