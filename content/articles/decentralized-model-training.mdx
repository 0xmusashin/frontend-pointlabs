How blockchain technology enables new paradigms for collaborative AI development.

## The Problem with Centralized Training

Training large AI models today requires massive computational resources. A single training run for a frontier model can cost tens of millions of dollars in compute alone. This concentration of resources creates several problems:

- **Access barriers** for researchers and smaller organizations
- **Single points of failure** in model development
- **Lack of transparency** in training data and methods
- **Centralized control** over AI capabilities

## A New Paradigm

Decentralized model training offers an alternative approach. By coordinating compute across many independent providers, we can:

### Reduce Barriers to Entry

Instead of requiring a single entity to fund entire training runs, costs can be distributed across a network of participants who contribute compute in exchange for rewards.

### Increase Resilience

Distributed training is inherently more fault-tolerant. If one node fails, others can continue the work without losing significant progress.

### Enable Transparency

On-chain coordination means training parameters, data sources, and contributor activities can be publicly verified.

## Technical Challenges

Building decentralized training systems isn't without challenges:

### Gradient Synchronization

Traditional distributed training relies on fast, reliable connections between nodes. Decentralized networks must handle higher latency and potential Byzantine actors.

### Verification

How do we ensure contributors are performing legitimate computations? This is where cryptographic proofs become essential.

### Economic Incentives

Designing reward mechanisms that encourage honest participation while preventing gaming requires careful economic modeling.

## Our Approach

At Point Labs, we're tackling these challenges through:

1. **Asynchronous training protocols** that tolerate network delays
2. **Cryptographic verification** of compute contributions
3. **Stake-based reputation systems** to align incentives

## Looking Ahead

The infrastructure for decentralized AI training is still early, but the foundations are being laid. We believe this approach will eventually enable a more open and accessible AI ecosystem.

Stay tuned for technical deep dives into our protocols and implementations.
