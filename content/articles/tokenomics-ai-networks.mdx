Designing incentive mechanisms for decentralized AI infrastructure.

## The Challenge

Decentralized AI networks require coordination between many different participants:

- **Compute providers** who contribute GPU resources
- **Data providers** who supply training data
- **Validators** who verify computations
- **Users** who consume AI services
- **Developers** who build and maintain models

How do we align all these incentives? This is where tokenomics comes in.

## Core Principles

Effective tokenomic design for AI networks should:

### Reward Honest Contribution

Participants should be compensated fairly based on the value they provide. A compute provider contributing more resources should earn more rewards.

### Punish Bad Behavior

Malicious actors who submit invalid computations or corrupted data should face consequences—typically through stake slashing.

### Enable Sustainable Growth

The economic model must work at small scale while remaining viable as the network grows to millions of participants.

### Remain Simple Enough to Understand

Overly complex mechanisms create opportunities for exploitation and make it hard for participants to make rational decisions.

## Key Mechanisms

### Staking

Participants lock tokens as collateral to participate in the network. This stake can be slashed if they misbehave, creating a financial incentive for honest behavior.

### Work Rewards

Compute providers earn tokens proportional to their verified contributions. The reward rate may adjust based on network demand and supply.

### Validation Bounties

Validators who catch invalid computations earn a portion of the offender's slashed stake. This creates a competitive market for verification.

### Usage Fees

Users pay fees to access AI services. These fees flow to compute providers, validators, and the protocol treasury.

## Open Questions

Tokenomic design for AI networks is still an active research area:

- How do we fairly value different types of contributions (compute vs data vs validation)?
- What's the optimal inflation rate to bootstrap the network without devaluing existing holdings?
- How do we prevent Sybil attacks and ensure decentralization?
- Can we design mechanisms that are robust to MEV and front-running?

## Our Approach

At Point Labs, we're taking an iterative approach to tokenomics:

1. Start with simple, proven mechanisms
2. Collect data on network behavior
3. Refine based on empirical evidence
4. Avoid premature optimization

We believe the best tokenomic designs will emerge from real-world experimentation rather than theoretical modeling alone.

## Conclusion

Getting tokenomics right is critical for decentralized AI networks. The incentive structure determines whether the network will attract honest participants and grow sustainably.

We'll share more details about our specific tokenomic design as it develops. Follow along as we build the economic foundation for decentralized AI.
